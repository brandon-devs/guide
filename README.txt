A privacy and security guide for those who care.


Section I: OS
=============
You have a few options when it comes to operating systems. The first I'll mention is Linux. Now, I'll start this off by saying that Linux is not secure. It is inherently flawed, as are all operating systems. However, it is still a good choice when it comes to privacy and security because it is not controlled nor managed by big tech. The best distributions are Fedora, Arch, and Void. DO NOT USE A "STABLE RELEASE DISTRO". These distrobutions freeze packages, meaning that there are bound to be security issues that have not been patched. Fedora is a great choice for all because they stay up-to-date, use FOSS under the hood, and utilize modern software such as Wayland. Arch is another good option because of the AUR, rolling releases, and customizability (in terms of the kernel, DE, and so on). Void is unique, because it uses runit rather than systemd and musl instead of glibc. Both of these substitutions are better than the alternative, because they are lightweight and secure. If you want to take it a step further, you can use Qubes or Tails. Qubes is not a Linux distribution, but rather it's own operating system. It has a steep learning curve but has features like virtualization for all apps, trust control, and more. Tails is a live OS that runs all your traffic through Tor, anonymyizing the user. Both are great choices for extremists. Overall, Fedora is recommended for the average user.

Section II.I: Browser Selection
===============================
Choosing a browser is a lot easier than choosing an OS, because there's really only two choices - Chromium and Firefox. Of course, there are forks of the two (Which are always better), but those are the two that almost every browser is based on. I'll keep it short - Chromium is more secure, while Firefox is a better choice for those avoiding Google. Chromium has extremely good sandboxing features, addons, site isolation, etc. while Firefox has lesser so security but isn't based on Google's code. There are Firefox forks that make it more secure and improve on features that Firefox is lacking in, like Librewolf, but it's not quite as good as Chromium. Now in reality, you'll be using Brave (A Chromium fork) or Librewolf (A Firefox fork). It's really up to you which one of these you use, but you have to make some improvements regardless to secure it. That's what we'll cover in the next section.

Section II.II: Browser Hardening
================================
The first step in browser hardening is addons. Remember, the less applications you have, the smaller the attack surface. So there's only a few nessessary addons you'll need. The first is uBlock Origin, a content blocker that protects you from ads, popups, and more. This isn't required on Librewolf nor Brave (since they both have it integrated), but it's good to know about. The next is Decentraleyes, an extremely important extension. It is designed for local content delivery network emulation, or, in Layman's terms, to mask your private info. Additionally there's HTTPS Everywhere (Self-explanatory name), NoScript (Content blocker), and I Don't Care About Cookies (Blocks those cookie popups and turns all cookies off). All of these are important to keeping your browser safe, secure, and private. Now the second step in hardening your browser is settings. Simply go through your browser's setting menus, and do the following. Set the security protocol to strict, clear history/cache on close, and turn off whatever you can. 

Section II.III: Tor Browser
===========================
There is one browser that I didn't mention in section II.I, and that's the Tor browser. I skipped over it because it's unique - it routes all of your traffic over the Tor network. Tor stands for "The Onion Router", because it runs your request through multiple Tor "nodes". Each of these nodes further obfuscates your computer's request, and anonymyzes you. The Tor browser, with hardening and modifications, is the absolute best browser for privacy.

Section III: Search Engine
==========================
The search engine is the piece of software that crawls the Internet for you, looking for websites that match your query. The most widely used one is Google - A search engine that censors it's results, collects its user's info, and places ads in its results. Google, Bing, and Yahoo are all search engines that you should avoid. The ones that you should be looking at are DuckDuckGo, SearX, and Startpage. These are all great options, each with their own quirks and benefits. DuckDuckGo integrates its own results with Bing, SearX let's you pick and choose how you want it to aggregate results, and Startpage is a private Google frontend. SearX is subjectively the best, because it's fully open-source, hasn't had any drama, and let's you fully customize it. But DuckDuckGo is the most widely used out of the three, has results that some people absolutely love, and is extremely easy to use. Startpage is the best for those coming from Google, since it will have the same results you know and love. But the biggest flaw to Startpage is that it will give you the censored Google results, so it's not the ideal pick. I would recommend SearX, but as always, it's up to you.

Section IV: VPNs
================
Let me preface this by saying that VPNs are NOT private. They can be a great tool to hide your traffic from your ISP, hide your IP from others, and unblock content, but that's about it. For real privacy and anonymity, you should use the Tor browser. Please keep this in mind as you read on. There's also a lot of malicious VPNs out there that sell your data just like Google - VPNs like NordVPN. There are few that can be trusted. The only VPNs that I can recommend are ProtonVPN, Mullvad, and iVPN. Both Mullvad and iVPN are paid, making them more trustworthy, but ProtonVPN is a good choice for those who don't want to spend money. Proton is a great company that will be brough up in the coming sections as well.

Section V: Password Manager
===========================
There are two different types of password managers - Offline and Online. Offline password managers are supreme to online ones (Since they cannot be cracked due to a security breach), but online password managers provide syncing and ease of use. For online password managers there's Bitwarden, and for offline there's KeepassXC. Bitwarden offers browser extensions, desktop apps, CLIs, and more. KeepassXC is the best choice for those who want their accounts to be as secure as possible, and if you care that much, you may want to store your password database on an encrypted thumb drive.

Section VI: Email
=================
Tutanota and ProtonMail are two of the best private email services on the Internet. They both provide E2EE, 0 data collection, and other privacy-respecting features. Both can be recommended to just about anyone, and it doesn't quite matter what you choose. I would personally recommend Proton (as you can use the same account for both your email and your VPN), but this section is mostly subjective. Do some reasearch of your own and choose what you think is right. Another part of email, though, is your email client. Thunderbird is a great choice for this and even comes pre-loaded on a few Linux distros.

Section VII: Smartphones
========================
People take the smartphones everywhere, and those smartphones are tracking exactly what their users say, what they do, and where they go. Most people think that the only two mobile operating systems are iOS and Android, and so they simply use one of the two, and let the phones track them. But here's the thing - Android is open source. This means that anyone can see the code and modify it. That's how custom ROMs were born. The two most popular Android forks are GrapheneOS and CalyxOS. GrapheneOS is better than CalyxOS, and I can say for certain that it is the only mobile OS that you should be using. It's essentially a better, De-Googled Android. You can use F-Droid and the Aurora Store for apps. To use GrapheneOS you will need one of the compatible phones (Your best choice is a Pixel). If you want to take it a step further, you can tear out the camera, microphone, and other potentially malicious pieces of hardware. The best way to do this is to watch teardown videos of whatever phone you have, locate what you want to get rid of, and safely remove it.

Section VIII: Social Media
=========================
Social media is bad in just about every way. It's terrible for mental health, it ruins attention span, it's a timesink, it's terrible for privacy and security, and so on. My advice to you is to quit it. It will benefit you in just about every way, privacy included. If you really, really need it, there's a few options for you. Invidious is a Youtube frontend (Check out https://yewtu.be) for those who don't want to abandon Youtube, Nitter is a private Twitter frontend (https://nitter.net), and Signal is the gold standard for messanging apps (Ditch WhatsApp and Telegram! https://signal.org).
