### Section I: Operating System
<details>
<summary>Fedora</summary>
<br>
Fedora is the best operating system choice for those who want an easy-to-use but secure desktop. Fedora adopts new technology such as Wayland into their operating system which keeps it modern and up to date. They also use vanilla GNOME, so while it won't be as lightweight as a plain WM, it's definitely better than the bloated version of GNOME that Ubuntu has.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Arch</summary>
<br>
Arch Linux is a DIY OS. You can get it with nothing but the essentials, and then install whatever WM/DE you want. The biggest benefit to using Arch is the AUR, which is a package manager in which anyone can upload their programs. It's also a rolling release distro meaning you'll have patches for vulnerabilities as soon as they're released.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Void</summary>
<br>
Void is a lot like Arch in the sense that it's an extremely minimal and lightweight distribution. There are, however, two key differences. Void uses runit instead of systemd and musl instead of glibc. Both of these alternatives are much better than the original and offer a great advantage over Arch in terms of security. You do sacrifice some of the convienience you get with Arch, but it's still a great option.

<details>
<summary>Tails</summary>
<br>
Tails is a live operating system meant to be stored on a thumb drive. It routes all of your traffic through Tor, anonymizing your activity. It's not recommended to daily drive Tails, but it's a decent choice if you're doing something that requires heightened privacy. I recommend using Etcher (https://www.balena.io/etcher/) for making your live USB.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Qubes</summary>
<br>
Qubes is the best option here in terms of security. It offers features like virtualization for all apps, advanced trust control, and more. It has an extremely steep learning curve and, like Tails, is not recommended for daily usage. But if you really want to commit to your digital safety Qubes is something you should look into.
</details>

### Section II: Browser
<details>
<summary>Brave</summary>
<br>
Brave is the browser I'd recommend to normies. Brave is based on Chromium, which means it comes with the same great sandboxing and site isolation that Chrome has. There's also built-in ad blocking, tracker blocking, and privacy features. The biggest downside to using Brave is the fact that it's based on Google's code. Even thought it's not necessarily risky, getting away from big tech is something that everyone should strive for. But if you don't really care about that this is your best option. 
</details>
<details>
<summary>Librewolf</summary>
<br>
Librwolf is based on Firefox, another mainstream browser. Firefox comes with some security issues (Like fingerprinting) but Librewolf aims to solve that. It's a fork of Firefox that has uBlock (Ad/Content blocker), fingerprint obfuscation, HTTPS-Only mode, etc. Because it's based on Firefox it's a good browser if you want to get away from big tech.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Tor</summary>
<br>
Tor stands for "The Onion Router." It's called this because Tor routes your traffic over 3 "nodes," protecting your identity with layers like an onion. Each of these nodes further obfuscates your computer's request, and anonymyzes you. The Tor browser is the absolute best browser for anonymity. Modifying Tor will change your fingerprint and make you stand out though, so beware.
</details>

### Section III: Search Engine
<details>
<summary>DuckDuckGo</summary>
<br>
DDG (DuckDuckGo) is the most popular private alternative to Google Search. It pulls results from a pool of browsers (Mostly Bing) for you in a secure manner. It's extremely easy to transition to this engine from Google and doesn't have the tracking or ads that others may have.
</details>
<details>
<summary>SearX</summary>
<br>
For most search engines, we just have to trust the company when they say that they aren't collecting any of our information. We can have a general idea of what's happening behind the scenes, but we never really know. But SearX is different. SearX can be modified to pull results from whatever search engines you want, to remove trackers from the URLs, to pull information from GitHub. It can also be self hosted, meaning that there's multiple instances each with their own pros and con.s
</details>
<details>
<summary>Startpage</summary>
<br>
Startpage gets its results from Google. If you like Google results and don't want to make a big change then Startpage will be the option for you. It retrieves information from Google in a secure manner without giving away your IP/data/etc. The problem with Startpage is that Google censors and controls its results, so you won't get the most accurate sites.
</details>

### Section IV: VPNs
<details>
<summary>ProtonVPN</summary>
<br>
Proton is a free, privacy-respecting company based in Switzerland. They offer a number of services (VPNs, email, cloud storage) and they're a generally well-trusted company in the field. Their VPN is the only trusted free VPN out there.
